## Overview

### Exercise
![Input field with expanded emoji picker interface](preview/emojipicker_expanded.png)

We need to develop an input field with an interface for adding emoji.

- The input field should resize to fit the entered text.
- When you click on the icon on the right, a drop-down emoji selection interface should open.
- In the emoji selection interface, there are 2 icons at the bottom. They switch the view mode between the entire list and recently used emojis (you can remember, for example, the last 25 used).

### Additional task

You can do an additional task: find and highlight menus, hashtags, links and email addresses in the input field.
